* User/organization pages won't push to the master branch (for obvious reasons), so do the scriptâ€“dance
* Verify: project pages that push to gh-pages branch won't contain `output` folder, but "Convert to HTML" tool will generate it? (deploy script could do this, but why not the tool doesn't work in similar way?)
* application.css won't get minimized, but application.js is? WTF?!
