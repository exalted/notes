* 20% of my time to do anything I like?
* Agile/pair programming/etc.?
* Which tools (VCS, GitHub, CIS) are you using?
* Can I have whatever PC/Mac setup that I want?
* Salary?


## Get Ready!

* Get confident at one (or two) programming languages that you can actually code at/from home
* Testing

### Also Study Some Sh*t

* [Computational complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory#Important_complexity_classes)
* Different Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
* [Data Structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)
* http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
* SOLID (object-oriented design) (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion)
